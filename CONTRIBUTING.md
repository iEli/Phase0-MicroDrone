# Contributing to Phase‑0 MicroDrone
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Phase‑0 Autonomous MicroDrone Project!  
This RCOS Fall 2026 initiative develops software and simulation foundations for a future microdrone.
Phase 0 contributions include code, documentation, simulation fixtures, and tests.

---

## Project Overview
Read [START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md) for the authoritative Phase 0 scope and team responsibilities.

CV work is limited to synthetic frames, preprocessing, logging, and timestamped detection stubs. Other modules consume those observations and own mission, docking, and safety decisions. Marker detection is optional stretch work; pose estimation belongs in Phase 1.

Hardware integration and further capabilities will be scoped separately.

## How to Get Started

### 1. Fork the Repository
Create your own fork of the repo:
https://github.com/contextualai-systems/Phase0-MicroDrone

### 2. Clone Your Fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Phase0-MicroDrone.git  
cd Phase0-MicroDrone

### 3. Create a Branch
Use descriptive branch names:
git checkout -b feature-motion-engine  
git checkout -b fix-camera-init  
git checkout -b docs-update

### 4. Install Dependencies
A requirements file or Docker container will be provided.  
Simulation instructions for Gazebo/Webots will also be included.

## Good First Issues
Beginner‑friendly tasks are listed under **Issues**:

Examples:
- Add logging to CV pipeline
- Write documentation for motion engine
- Create simple OpenCV script
- Build basic tilt/rotation behavior in simulation
- Add interior‑sensor mock data
- Improve simulation environment assets
- Create unit tests for safety rules

---

## Code Guidelines

### Python
- Follow PEP‑8 style guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add comments for non‑obvious logic
- Keep functions small and modular

### Motion Engine / Safety Layer
- Use deterministic logic
- Document all thresholds and parameters
- Include test cases in `/tests`

### Computer Vision
- Keep CV scripts in `src/cv/`
- Include sample images or mock data when possible
- Log intermediate results for debugging

### Simulation
- Place world files and models in `simulation/`
- Document how to run your simulation scenario

---

## Testing
Before submitting a pull request:
- Run unit tests in `/tests`
- Test motion behaviors in simulation
- Validate safety rules (no‑launch zones, interior mode, human detection)
- Confirm code runs on Jetson Nano if applicable

---

## Pull Requests
All contributions must be submitted through a Pull Request (PR).

### PR Requirements:
- Clear description of the change
- Reference any related Issue
- Screenshots or logs if relevant
- Tests included when possible
- No breaking changes without discussion

### PR Review Process:
- Maintainers review for correctness and clarity
- Requested changes must be addressed
- Once approved, PR will be merged into `main`

---

## Collaboration Expectations
- Be kind, supportive, and curious
- Ask questions early
- Attend weekly RCOS stand‑ups
- Coordinate with other sub‑teams (CV, Motion, Safety, Docking, Simulation)
- Document everything you build
