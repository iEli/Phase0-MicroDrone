"""All the safety numbers in one place.

These numbers come from the team's INTEGRATION_README (Section 5).
They are made-up numbers for the pretend simulation, not real drone limits.

Keeping them here means everyone uses the same numbers. If the team changes
a rule, we change it once here instead of hunting through the code.
