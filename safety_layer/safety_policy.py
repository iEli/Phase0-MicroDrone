"""The safety referee.

Every tick (10 times per pretend second), this looks at what's happening
right now and says which actions the drone is allowed to do.

It checks problems in order of how bad they are. The first matching level
decides the response:

    1. Emergency    -> something is really wrong, land immediately
    2. Abort        -> cancel what we're doing and stop in place
    3. Restrictions -> only block the actions the problem actually affects
    4. Proceed      -> everything else is fine, go ahead

Safety does NOT move the drone and does NOT decide what the drone should do
next. It only says what is allowed. Other people's code decides the rest.

The current time is passed in, not looked up, so tests always get the same
answers no matter how fast the computer runs.
