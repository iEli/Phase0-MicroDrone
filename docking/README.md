# Docking — synthetic integration milestone

[Shared integration contract](../INTEGRATION_README.md), especially Sections 4–8,
controls the interface and defaults. Docking owns only its lowercase local phase;
the central coordinator owns the mission, return latch, shared timers, command
selection/dispatch, and logging. Inputs and movement are synthetic for this
milestone. Physical charging, marker pose estimation, and moving-pad landing are
outside its scope.

## Interface

`docking.states` exports `DockingController`, `DockingConfig`, `DockingInput`,
`DockingUpdate`, `PadObservation`, and `compute_return_request`.

Call `controller.update(inputs, now_ns)` once per coordinator tick, using integer
simulation nanoseconds starting at zero. The injected clock must be nonnegative
and monotonic; a programmer supplying an invalid clock gets `ValueError`.
All positions use local ENU: x east, y north, z up, meters; yaw is degrees, zero
east, counterclockwise positive. The fixed pad must have z = 0.

Inputs include:

- The coordinator's `mission_state`, `flight_active`, bird absence/ordinary hover
  start times, and explicit retry/reset events. `hover_started_ns` excludes launch
  climb. Bird absence time clears on detection; invalid camera input follows the
  return policy instead of accumulating absence time.
- Fresh `VehicleFeedback` from `motion_engine.contracts`, preserving its original
  timestamp and command execution status.
- Fresh, valid `PadObservation` with a fixed ENU `Pose`.
- Fresh `SafetyAssessment` from `safety_layer.safety_policy`. Safety owns battery
  thresholds and action permissions. Missing or malformed permissions fail closed.
- Synthetic alignment validity, integer `alignment_timestamp_ns`, `x_error_m`,
  `y_error_m`, `yaw_error_deg`, and a source ID. Alignment error is pad minus
  vehicle position/yaw, never a CV bounding-box interpretation.
- Environment validity/time and the explicit boolean `cart_moving`.

The immutable output supplies `should_dock`, ordered return `reasons`, local
`phase`/`state`, `progress`, `landed_on_pad`, `failure`/`failure_reason`, a stable
transition `reason`, and a proposed Motion `Command` or null. Metadata uses
`schema_version = 1`, `clock = "simulation"`, and `synthetic = true`.
`controller.transitions` is an immutable snapshot of state-change records.

## Return policy and mission lifecycle

`compute_return_request` is separate from approach/descent permissions. During
active flight, it reports Safety's low-battery and tracking restrictions, invalid
or stale camera samples, 3 seconds of continuous valid bird absence, or 10 seconds
of ordinary hover. Unavailable tracking geometry alone causes hold first;
continued unavailability reaches the hover timeout. Grounded IDLE ignores return
requests. Low battery requests docking and does not itself abort a docking attempt.

The coordinator latches the first committed return and preserves its original
start time across retries. A reappearing bird may clear a current return request,
but cannot clear that coordinator-owned latch. Docking neither duplicates battery
thresholds nor owns/resets the overall 60-second return deadline.

Only `DOCKING_APPROACH` activates phases or produces targets. Mission entry starts
one attempt; repeated ticks/command renewals do not restart it. Leaving that mission
state deactivates Docking and clears its local failure/timers. A subsequent entry
starts a fresh local attempt. An explicit `retry_requested` event can also restart
an aborted local attempt after hazards clear; the coordinator must first perform
its ABORT recovery/hold handling. Neither path changes shared return context.

An explicit `reset_requested` event while active is accepted only with fresh,
grounded, disarmed, at-pad feedback, fresh stationary-cart inputs, and no Safety
abort/emergency. It clears the local phase/timers without moving the vehicle or
resetting mission context. Reset acceptance for the entire mission remains the
coordinator's responsibility.

## Section 8 phases

| Phase | Proposed action | Transition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| idle | None | Mission docking entry → approach |
| approach | GOTO_DOCK_APPROACH at configured altitude over pad | At position/altitude/yaw tolerance → align if alignment fresh, otherwise search |
| search | HOVER | Fresh valid alignment → align; search timeout → abort |
| align | MOVE_TO correcting horizontal position/yaw at approach altitude | Within horizontal/yaw tolerance and descent allowed → descend; lost alignment → search |
| descend | DESCEND_TO_DOCK to pad at z = 0 | Confirmed pad touchdown → complete; lost alignment, drift, or lost descent permission → abort |
| complete | No flight target; report landed_on_pad | Coordinator enters DOCKED and explicitly disarms |
| abort | No docking target; report failure | Coordinator enters ABORT; Safety supplies fallback |

Any active phase aborts on lost approach permission, an invalid required input,
Safety abort/emergency, or attempt timeout. Timers trigger at or beyond their limit;
search timeout wins over newly available alignment at the boundary. Attempt time
continues across search/align changes. A completed/aborted phase remains latched
until the documented exit, retry, or reset lifecycle.

Proposals reuse `motion_engine.contracts.Command` and `Pose`; they carry ENU frame,
issue/expiry times, source, reason, speed limits, and IDs stable across unchanged
renewals. Changed targets get a new ID. The coordinator must validate every proposal
and the active command with Safety, replacing an unsafe previous target before
Motion steps. A null docking target never means it is safe to leave an old descent
command running. Docking does not dispatch, disarm, or implement fallback commands.

## Defaults and confirmation

Defaults are centralized in `safety_layer/config.py` and injected through
`DockingConfig`: 0.25 m arrival/horizontal tolerance, 3° yaw tolerance, 5 m approach
altitude, 0.5 s observation age, 5 s search timeout, 30 s attempt timeout, and 0.2 s
command validity. Horizontal/vertical limits default to 5/2 m/s. These are synthetic
settings, not validated physical flight parameters.

Completion requires fresh valid vehicle/pad/environment feedback, grounded and
not airborne, settled ordinary landing status (`LANDED` with active `LAND` or
`DESCEND_TO_DOCK` command), vehicle and landing target at z = 0, horizontal pad
error within tolerance, stationary cart, and retained descent permission/alignment.
Arrival (`arrived`/`at_target`) or command acceptance alone cannot confirm landing.
Emergency landing cannot produce ordinary docking completion.

## Synthetic alignment and checks

`docking.alignment.calculate_alignment` accepts `LocalPosition(x_m, y_m, origin_id,
frame="local_enu", yaw_deg=...)` fixtures plus an integer `timestamp_ns`. Both
positions require the same named origin. It returns signed x/y offsets, wrapped
yaw error, horizontal distance, validity, source, and reason. Invalid/missing
positions, nonfinite numbers, mismatched origins/frames, or invalid times yield
unavailable alignment. Freshness is checked by the controller.

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_docking*.py' -v
python3 -m docking.run_docking --scenario success --log /tmp/docking-success.jsonl
```

`run_docking` is a module diagnostic replay of recorded inputs, not a second
mission loop. It does not move Motion, dispatch targets, or decide mission state.
Fixtures supply mission entry and recorded landing feedback. Other scenarios are
`missing`, `stale`, `low-battery`, and `cart-moving`. Low battery allows completion;
missing/stale alignment and cart motion abort descent. Logs include ENU,
nanoseconds, controller inputs, proposals, and outcomes. Production logging uses
the coordinator's shared logger; the diagnostic JSONL writer is for local checks.
`--log` overwrites the given file; its parent directory must exist. Without it,
records go to stdout. The outcome summary goes to stderr; a successfully replayed
abort fixture exits with code 0.

The tests cover phase transitions, blocked pads, yaw/horizontal drift, invalid or
stale inputs, timeout boundaries, return triggers, retries/reset, and actual
MotionStub feedback through touchdown followed by explicit disarming. Wiring
these values into the central coordinator and running the full mission/retry
scenarios remains integration-team work.
